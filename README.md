# JSB-Kanga

## Synopsis

A simple 4 page HTML/CSS website for the earthworks company, JSB Kanga. 

## Motivation

I was contacted by Scott from JSB Kanga and he asked me to make a website for him. After talking to him, I found he wanted a very basic website where he could send people to get information about his company.
